  Format: Mixed, png, windows bitmap, Adobe Photoshop CS4 .psd files.

   Notes:
I use 1680x1050 (widescreen) with vid_conwidth 840 and vid_conheight 525
Based on charset Bugs3 (Bugs-05) http://gfx.quakeworld.nu/details/94/  which
AFAIK was done by Bugsy. All credits goes to his work that was the basis fo my
color adjustments - I thought this font is really nice, smooth and well
readable. 
Notice that colors are tweked for my color needs - so your experience may vary 
depending on the console background and in game textures and so on.

I provide source .psd I used, maybe someone will want to alter it.
